stuff that should happen


make graphtemplate metrics it's own array to merge each thing associated to a metric together



fix the ability to define a specific color for each metric

add some view options to the template - which sum/agg/host/service combos allowed


expand/collapse service and host view someway  (to only show the selected service/host vs just taking us to them)

//...if you use a named color that isnt in the list, we should alert


..alias/label when no alias speced needs help
